Thanks to Allah for supporting me to build this kind of project.. 


This is my Part Time project, so if the development is slow forgive me. I need to manage my own task.

### About

<b>BroGaib</b> is just a simple browser based on ElectronJS, This browser is different from any other browser, because this browser is crafted specially for developers who need to customize anything (keyboard shortcut, auto run script, etc...) .
As a Developer I need browser that can be Customized and Run <b>"Mouse Free"</b> Environment (because it is a pain in my arm), Just Like the beauty of Unix Terminal when you just run simple command and everything is work as you wish. This Browser is not mean for Perfection. But it should get the job done efficiently.
